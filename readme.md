# TCNJ ACM: Bad Code Challenge

> A horribly structured program that outputs the letters of the English alphabet in a random order.

## Background

The College of New Jersey's ACM chapter asked each attendee of a recent meeting to write a program that outputs the letters of the English alphabet in a random order and make the program's code as awful and unmaintainable as possible.

This repository is the result.

## Usage

```sh
$ python3 bad.py
```
